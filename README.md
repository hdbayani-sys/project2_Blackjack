# ♣️♥️Blackjack Overview♦️♠️
Blackjack is my second software project to be submitted for EEE 111 under my instructor, Sr. Philip Tuason. This project contains an interactive and digital recreation of Blackjack, with the standard Blackjack game rules and procedures, accompanied with other features to make this recreation a standout to other digital Blackjack recreations. This was built using Visual Studio Code with Python ver 3.13 as the programming language.

## 🕹Features🃏
**Blackjack** includes the following game features:
- Multiple players competing against a dealer locally
- Betting system where players are initially given a balance which they can use to place bets each round.
- Eliminates broke players (Or if somehow, be in debt.).
- A dealer controlled by a computer that follows standard blackjack rules.
- User friendly outputs that allow the player to see each output at their own pace as well as seeing who's turn it is, their current score, and their new balance when resolving rounds.
- Randomized dialogue during betting, dealing, and in between rounds
- Option for players to continue playing or to cash out early. Game ends if all players are eliminated by having insufficient balance or voluntarily quitting
