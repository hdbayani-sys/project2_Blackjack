# ♣️♥️Blackjack Overview♦️♠️
Blackjack is my second software project to be submitted for EEE 111 under my instructor, Sr. Philip Tuason. This project contains an interactive and digital recreation of Blackjack, with the standard Blackjack game rules and procedures, accompanied with other features to make this recreation a standout to other digital Blackjack recreations. This was built using Visual Studio Code with Python as my programming language.
